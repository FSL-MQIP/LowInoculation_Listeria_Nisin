# LowInoculation_Listeria_Nisin

## Purpose
This repository includes data and codes associated with the data analyses performed for the low inoculation study.

## File description
### LowInoc_Data_RC042522.csv
This is the dataset containing the L. monocytogenes enumeration data on cold-smoked salmon.

### LowInoc_Models_RC042522.R
This is the script for performing statistical modeling to investigate (i) the odds of complete elimination of L. monocytogenes on cold-smoked salmon due to 250 ppm nisin treatments and (ii) the level of L. monocytogenes on cold-smoked salmon when complete elimination was not achieved.
